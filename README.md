# HTML Simple Calculator

## Core Concept:
### 1. Structure with HTML - A display area for buttons, input, and layout arrangement.
### 2. Style with CSS - CSS makes everything nice, with CSS we can arrange and change the style of the tags in HTML.
### 3. Logic with Javascript
-  `insertValue(integer: value)` Inserts the value given in the parameter.
- `addOperator(string: value)` Stores the first operand variable (`var firstOperand;`) then clears the next input for the second operand variable  (`var secondOperand;`).
- `equals()` Takes the current input and stored as second operand variable and performs the calculation using the given operator and shows the result.
